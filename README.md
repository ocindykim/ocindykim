#### Overview
As part of a team, I developed a web-based service called "Something to Drink: 한눈에 쏙 리뷰" that helps consumers easily understand the opinions of other buyers for online purchases of zero-calorie drinks. This project required me to use my knowledge of marketing, as well as my skills in data analysis and visualization.


#### Methodology
The project was divided into four main stages: data collection, data processing, data visualization, and web development. I was responsible for the data processing and visualization stages of the project. We used the following tools and techniques:

- Data collection: I used web scraping techniques to collect reviews from various online shopping malls, including Naver Shopping, Coupang and Danawa.

- Data processing: I used Python and the KoNLPy library for natural language processing, including morphological analysis and keyword extraction. We also used Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.

- Data visualization: I used the text network analysis technique to create high-chart graphs that show the relationships between keywords in the reviews.
