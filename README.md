## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### ["Something to Drink: ÌïúÎààÏóê Ïèô Î¶¨Î∑∞"](https://github.com/ocindykim/Finalproject_multicampus)

#### Overview
As part of a team, I developed a web-based service called "Something to Drink: Reviews at a Glance" that helps consumers easily understand the opinions of other buyers for online purchases of zero-calorie drinks. This project required me to use my knowledge of marketing, as well as my skills in data analysis and visualization.

#### Methodology
The project was divided into four main stages: data collection, data processing, data visualization, and web development. I was responsible for the data processing and visualization stages of the project. We used the following tools and techniques:

Data collection: We used web scraping techniques to collect reviews from various online shopping malls, including Naver Shopping and Gmarket.
Data processing: We used Python and the KoNLPy library for natural language processing, including morphological analysis and keyword extraction. We also used Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
Data visualization: We used the text network analysis technique to create high-chart graphs that show the relationships between keywords in the reviews.
Web development: We used Django to create a web-based interface that users can use to interact with the data.
