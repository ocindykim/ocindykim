<br>

#### Overview
As part of a team, I developed a web-based service called "Something to Drink: ÌïúÎààÏóê Ïèô Î¶¨Î∑∞" that helps consumers easily understand the opinions of other buyers for online purchases of zero-calorie drinks. This project required me to use my expertise of marketing, as well as my skills in data analysis and visualization.
<br>

#### Methodology
The project was divided into four main stages: (1) data collection, (2) data processing, (3) data visualization, and (4) web development. I was particularly responsible for the data processing and web development of the project.
